🧠 VaultX – Password Manager

VaultX is a secure and modern Password Manager web application built using the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js — and styled with Tailwind CSS.

It provides a clean, responsive, and intuitive interface for managing passwords safely and efficiently. Users can store, view, copy, edit, and delete their credentials securely.

All passwords are handled in an encrypted and user-friendly environment, ensuring privacy and data security.
